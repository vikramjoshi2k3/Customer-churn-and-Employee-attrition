            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The issue of keeping one's employees happy and satisfied is a perennial and age-old challenge. If an
                    employee you have invested so much time and money leaves for "greener pastures", then this would
                    mean that you would have to spend even more time and money to hire somebody else. In the spirit of
                    ML, we therefore turn to our predictive modelling capabilities to see if we can predict employee
                    attrition.</p>
                <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis: </strong>We explore the dataset by taking a look at the feature
                    distributions, how correlated one feature is to the other and create some Seaborn and Plotly
                    visualisations.</p>

            <h2>KDEplots</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plot is a type of visualization technique used to represent the
                    probability density function of a continuous random variable.</p>
                <p>A KDE plot displays the density estimate of a variable, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.
                    In
                    a KDE plot, a kernel function is placed at each data point and then smoothed out to create a
                    continuous
                    density estimate.</p>
                <p>A bivariate KDE plot is a type of visualization that shows the joint distribution of two variables
                    using
                    a kernel density estimate.</p>
                <p>In a bivariate KDE plot, a two-dimensional density estimate is created by placing a kernel function
                    at
                    each point in the two-dimensional space. These kernel functions are then smoothed out to create a
                    continuous surface that represents the density of the data.</p>
                <p>The plot shows the joint distribution of the two variables, with contours or shading indicating the
                    areas
                    of highest density. This can help identify patterns and relationships between the two variables,
                    such as
                    correlation or clustering.</p>
                <p>With the help of Seaborn plotting library we can generate bivariate plots as follows:</p>

            <h2>Pairplot Visualisation</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Seaborn's pairplot is a type of visualization that allows for the creation of a grid of plots, where
                    each
                    variable in a dataset is plotted against every other variable. This creates a visual representation
                    of
                    the pairwise relationships between the variables, making it easier to identify patterns and
                    correlations
                    in the data.</p>
                <p>Each plot in the pairplot displays a scatterplot of the two variables and a histogram of each
                    variable's
                    distribution. Additionally, diagonal plots show a kernel density estimate of the distribution of
                    each
                    variable. Pairplots can also be customized with various options, including adding regression lines,
                    changing the color scheme, and displaying categorical variables using different symbols or colors.
                    Overall, pairplot is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis, as it allows for quick and
                    comprehensive visual inspection of relationships between variables in a dataset.</p>
                <p>We can create some Seaborn pairplots and set it against the target variable which is our Attrition
                    column
                    to get a feel for how the various features are distributed vis-a-vis employee attrition.</p>

            <h2>Feature Ranking via the Random Forest</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The Random Forest classifier in Sklearn also contains a very convenient attribute feature_importances_ which tells us which features within our dataset has been given most importance through the Random Forest algorithm. Shown below is a Plotly diagram of the various feature importances.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Overall, EDA is an essential step in the data analysis process, as it can help identify issues, inform modeling and analysis decisions, and communicate insights to stakeholders.</p>
