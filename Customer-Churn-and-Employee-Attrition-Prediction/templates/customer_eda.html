        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Customer churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to stop using a product
                or service in the near future. This technique is widely used in various industries, including
                telecommunications, banking, and e-commerce, to forecast customer behavior and develop retention
                strategies. Churn prediction models can be built using machine learning algorithms and historical
                customer data to predict the likelihood of customer churn.</p>
            <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis: </strong>We explore the dataset by taking a look at the feature
                distributions, how correlated one feature is to the other and create some Seaborn and Plotly
                visualisations.</p>

        <h2>Jointplots</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Jointplots are a type of data visualization technique used to display the relationship between two
                variables in a dataset. They combine two different plots into one, showing a scatter plot of the data
                along with a probability density function or a histogram for each variable. This helps to identify
                patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data, making it easier to interpret and draw insights from
                the data. Jointplots are commonly used in data analysis and statistical modeling to understand the
                relationship between two variables and make data-driven decisions.</p>

        <h2>Pairplot Visualisation</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Seaborn's pairplot is a type of visualization that allows for the creation of a grid of plots, where
                each
                variable in a dataset is plotted against every other variable. This creates a visual representation
                of
                the pairwise relationships between the variables, making it easier to identify patterns and
                correlations
                in the data.</p>
            <p>Each plot in the pairplot displays a scatterplot of the two variables and a histogram of each
                variable's
                distribution. Additionally, diagonal plots show a kernel density estimate of the distribution of
                each
                variable. Pairplots can also be customized with various options, including adding regression lines,
                changing the color scheme, and displaying categorical variables using different symbols or colors.
                Overall, pairplot is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis, as it allows for quick and
                comprehensive visual inspection of relationships between variables in a dataset.</p>
